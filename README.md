The application recursively searches for complete 9x9 Sudoku boards using a multithreaded approach to improve performance. It runs five threads concurrently, each starting with a different initial board configuration to explore all possible Sudoku solutions. The program generates checkpoints at regular intervals to save the current state of the search, ensuring that progress is not lost in case of a system failure. Checkpoints are saved as JSON files, and the Sudoku boards are validated to meet the standard rules.

### Possible enhancements

#### Database Integration: 
Implementing database support will allow the application to store and retrieve Sudoku solutions efficiently.
By incorporating live threading, the application can dynamically adjust the number of threads based on real-time conditions. This will improve performance by optimizing thread usage according to the workload.

#### Error Handling: 
Strengthening error handling and recovery mechanisms will make the application more reliable.
